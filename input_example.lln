// Example demonstrating the inputln() function

println("What is your name?");
let name: string = inputln();

println("Hello,", name + "!");

println("How old are you?");
let age_str: string = inputln();

// We would need type conversion to treat age as an int, e.g., to_int(age_str)
// For now, just echo it as a string.
println(name, "is", age_str, "years old.");

println("Enter a sentence:");
let sentence: string = inputln();
println("You entered:", sentence);
